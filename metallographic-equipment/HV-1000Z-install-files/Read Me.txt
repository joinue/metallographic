To Use the HV-1000Z with your computer, you will need Hyperterminal and a serial port.  

If you do not have Hyperterminal, copy the entire Hypertm Files folder to your computer.  You can run it by opening the .exe file. 

If you do not have a serial port on your computer, you will need to use the USB-to serial adapter included with the HV-1000Z.  
To install the adapter drivers, run the .exe file in the Prolific driverinstaller file.  

You may need to restart your computer after installation.  

If the driver installed correctly, it should be visible in the device manager with no yellow exclamation mark.

After Hypertrm and the adapter driver files are installed, follow the instructions in the manual (Page 20-21).
