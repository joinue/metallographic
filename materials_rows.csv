The molybdenum addition provides superior corrosion resistance, especially to chlorides, compared to 304 stainless steel. The softness requires careful preparation to avoid smearing and deformation. Use low to moderate pressure throughout grinding and polishing to prevent deformation of the soft austenitic matrix. The high chromium, nickel, and molybdenum content provides excellent corrosion resistance but can make the material more difficult to etch than carbon steels. Standard stainless steel preparation procedures work well. Monitor for smearing during grinding and polishing - reduce pressure if any deformation is observed.

Aluminum-magnesium-manganese alloy with good strength and corrosion resistance, commonly used in general fabrication and pressure vessels. The very low hardness requires extremely careful preparation to avoid smearing, orange peel, and excessive relief. Use very low to low pressure throughout all preparation steps to prevent deformation of the very soft aluminum matrix. Sharp, fresh abrasives are essential to minimize smearing. The magnesium (2.7%), manganese (0.8%), and chromium (0.12%) content are in solid solution, so the material will respond well to standard aluminum etchants. The material exhibits work hardening, so strain-hardened conditions may show different microstructural features than annealed material. Monitor for smearing and relief during grinding and polishing - reduce pressure immediately if any deformation is observed. Commonly used in pressure vessels, tanks, and general fabrication due to good strength and corrosion resistance.","Use slow-speed diamond saw or abrasive cut-off wheel designed for non-ferrous materials. Standard cut-off wheel (1.0-1.5 mm thickness) is appropriate. Use adequate coolant flow to prevent overheating and minimize deformation. The very soft material requires gentle handling. Cutting speed: 150-200 RPM for most cut-off saws (slower than harder materials). Apply very light to light pressure - the very soft material requires extremely gentle handling to avoid excessive deformation and work hardening. Avoid forcing the cut which can cause sample damage, work hardening, and significant deformation. Leave adequate allowance (~1-2 mm) for grinding away the heat-affected zone and any deformation from cutting.","Cold mounting with epoxy resin is strongly preferred to avoid heat that could affect the very soft material. Use a low-shrinkage epoxy resin for best edge retention. Ensure complete cure before grinding to prevent edge rounding and maintain sample integrity. The mount should be slightly harder than the sample for better edge retention.<br /><br />Hot compression mounting is acceptable if the part tolerates ~150-180°C and moderate pressure (2000-3000 psi for phenolic), but cold mounting is recommended for this very soft material. Use phenolic or epoxy-phenolic resins. The very soft material requires extremely careful handling during mounting to avoid deformation. Ensure proper cooling under pressure to minimize shrinkage. For pressure vessel and general fabrication applications, ensure the mounting material is compatible with the intended use environment.","The very low hardness (62 HB) of 5454 Aluminum requires extremely careful grinding to avoid smearing and deformation.

The duplex microstructure benefits from etchants that provide color contrast or differential etching between phases.

Prepare fresh for best results. Solution is stable for a few days.</li><li><strong>Application:</strong> Immerse sample or swab for 30-60 seconds. Beraha's reagent provides color contrast between phases - ferrite typically appears darker (brown/blue) while austenite appears lighter.</li><li><strong>Reveals:</strong> Clear distinction between austenite and ferrite phases with color contrast.

The very low hardness requires extremely careful preparation to avoid smearing, orange peel, and excessive relief. Use low pressure throughout all preparation steps to prevent deformation of the very soft aluminum matrix. Sharp, fresh abrasives are essential to minimize smearing. The magnesium (2.5%) and chromium (0.25%) content are in solid solution, so the material will respond well to standard aluminum etchants. The material exhibits work hardening, so strain-hardened conditions may show different microstructural features than annealed material. Monitor for smearing and relief during grinding and polishing - reduce pressure immediately if any deformation is observed. Commonly used in marine hardware, sheet metal, and tanks due to excellent corrosion resistance, especially in marine environments.","Use slow-speed diamond saw or abrasive cut-off wheel designed for non-ferrous materials. Standard cut-off wheel (1.0-1.5 mm thickness) is appropriate. Use adequate coolant flow to prevent overheating and minimize deformation. The very soft material requires gentle handling. Cutting speed: 150-200 RPM for most cut-off saws (slower than harder materials). Apply very light to light pressure - the very soft material requires extremely gentle handling to avoid excessive deformation and work hardening. Avoid forcing the cut which can cause sample damage, work hardening, and significant deformation. Leave adequate allowance (~1-2 mm) for grinding away the heat-affected zone and any deformation from cutting.","Cold mounting with epoxy resin is strongly preferred to avoid heat that could affect the very soft material. Use a low-shrinkage epoxy resin for best edge retention. Ensure complete cure before grinding to prevent edge rounding and maintain sample integrity. The mount should be slightly harder than the sample for better edge retention.<br /><br />Hot compression mounting is acceptable if the part tolerates ~150-180°C and moderate pressure (2000-3000 psi for phenolic), but cold mounting is recommended for this very soft material. Use phenolic or epoxy-phenolic resins. The very soft material requires extremely careful handling during mounting to avoid deformation. Ensure proper cooling under pressure to minimize shrinkage. For marine applications, ensure the mounting material is compatible with the intended use environment.","The very low hardness (47 HB) of 5052 Aluminum requires extremely careful grinding to avoid smearing and deformation. Use standard SiC grinding papers with abundant water lubrication. Disc speed: 200-300 RPM. Apply very light to light pressure (15-25 N per 30 mm sample) - the very soft material is extremely prone to smearing if too much pressure is applied. Use sharp, fresh grinding papers to minimize deformation. Over-grinding can affect grain boundary revelation during etching.

Abundant water lubrication is critical - avoid drying during grinding which can cause severe smearing. Grind just long enough to remove the previous scratch orientation - over-grinding can affect grain boundary revelation and cause work hardening artifacts.","The very low hardness requires extremely careful polishing to avoid smearing and excessive relief.

The most common cast iron type, used extensively in engine blocks, machine bases, and pipes. The flake graphite is the critical microstructural feature - it appears as dark flakes in the matrix and must be preserved during preparation. The graphite is very soft and can be easily pulled out or damaged during grinding and polishing, so careful preparation is essential. Use moderate pressure throughout grinding and polishing to avoid graphite pullout. The pearlite matrix is medium-hard and can tolerate standard preparation procedures. The graphite provides good machinability and damping capacity. Monitor for graphite pullout during polishing - reduce pressure if graphite is being pulled out.","Use abrasive cut-off wheel designed for cast iron (Al₂O₃ or SiC abrasive). Standard cut-off wheel (1.0-1.5 mm thickness) is appropriate. Use adequate coolant flow to prevent overheating - excessive heat can affect the pearlite matrix and graphite structure. Cutting speed: 200-300 RPM for most cut-off saws. Apply steady, moderate pressure - the medium-hard material allows for reasonable feed rates. Avoid forcing the cut which can cause wheel wear and sample damage. Leave adequate allowance (~2-3 mm) for grinding away the heat-affected zone from cutting.","Cold mounting with epoxy resin is preferred to avoid heat that could affect the pearlite matrix or graphite structure. Use a low-shrinkage epoxy resin for best edge retention. Ensure complete cure before grinding to prevent edge rounding and maintain sample integrity.<br /><br />Hot compression mounting is acceptable if the part tolerates ~150-180°C and moderate pressure (3000-4000 psi for phenolic). Use phenolic or epoxy-phenolic resins designed for medium-hard materials. Ensure proper cooling under pressure to minimize shrinkage and maintain edge retention. For automotive, machinery, and construction applications, ensure the mounting material is compatible with the intended use environment.","The medium hardness (187 HB) of Gray Cast Iron allows for standard grinding procedures, but the flake graphite requires careful attention. Use standard SiC grinding papers with adequate water lubrication. Disc speed: 200-300 RPM. Apply moderate pressure (25-35 N per 30 mm sample) - the medium-hard material can tolerate reasonable pressure, but be careful not to pull out the soft graphite flakes. Use sharp, fresh grinding papers to minimize deformation and graphite pullout.<br /><br /><strong>Grinding sequence:</strong><ul style=""margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; padding-left: 1.5rem;""><li><strong>120 grit:</strong> Remove sectioning damage (30-60 seconds). Use moderate pressure to remove heat-affected zone. Monitor for graphite pullout.</li><li><strong>240 grit:</strong> Remove previous scratches (30-60 seconds). Ensure complete scratch removal. Continue monitoring for graphite pullout.</li><li><strong>320 grit:</strong> Further refinement (30-60 seconds). Continue scratch removal. The graphite should remain well-integrated with the matrix.</li><li><strong>400 grit:</strong> Refinement (30-60 seconds). Prepare for polishing. Ensure graphite is not being pulled out.</li><li><strong>600 grit:</strong> Final grinding step (30-60 seconds). Ensure all scratches are removed before polishing. The graphite flakes should be clearly visible and well-integrated.</li></ul>Always rotate the specimen holder 90° between steps to ensure complete scratch removal. Use complementary rotation (platen and holder same direction, different speeds) rather than contra-rotation to minimize deformation. Adequate water lubrication is critical. Monitor for graphite pullout throughout grinding - reduce pressure if graphite is being pulled out.","The medium hardness allows for standard polishing procedures, but the flake graphite is critical - it is very soft and can be easily pulled out during polishing. Use diamond polishing with appropriate polishing pads for each stage. Apply moderate pressure throughout, but monitor carefully for graphite pullout. The graphite flakes should remain well-integrated with the pearlite matrix.<br /><br /><strong>Diamond polishing sequence:</strong><ul style=""margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; padding-left: 1.5rem;""><li><strong>6μm diamond:</strong> 3-4 minutes on a medium-hard synthetic pad (e.g., TEXPAN) with moderate pressure (25-35 N per 30 mm sample). Start with 6μm for medium-hard materials. Monitor for graphite pullout - reduce pressure if graphite is being pulled out. The graphite flakes should remain well-integrated.</li><li><strong>3μm diamond:</strong> 3-4 minutes on a medium-hard synthetic pad (e.g., TEXPAN) or non-woven intermediate pad with moderate pressure. Continue removing scratches from previous step. Continue monitoring for graphite pullout.</li><li><strong>1μm diamond:</strong> 2-3 minutes on a low-napped pad designed for fine polishing (e.g., GOLD PAD) with lighter pressure (20-30 N). These pads provide consistent material removal and flatness control. Monitor for graphite pullout - reduce pressure if needed.</li></ul><strong>Final polishing:</strong><ul style=""margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; padding-left: 1.5rem;""><li><strong>0.05μm colloidal silica:</strong> 1-2 minutes on a high-napped final polishing pad (e.g., MICROPAD) with light pressure. High-napped pads are recommended for colloidal silica and produce a mirror finish. This removes any remaining fine scratches and prepares the surface for etching. Monitor for graphite pullout - reduce polishing time if graphite is being pulled out. The graphite flakes should remain well-integrated with the matrix.</li></ul>Use appropriate polishing lubricants. The medium hardness means standard polishing times work well - ensure complete scratch removal at each step. The flake graphite is the critical feature - monitor for pullout throughout polishing. If excessive graphite pullout occurs, reduce polishing time or pressure. The graphite flakes should be polished evenly with the pearlite matrix to prevent pullout during etching or examination.","Gray Cast Iron responds well to standard cast iron etchants. The flake graphite will appear as dark areas in the etched matrix. The pearlite matrix will reveal clearly with appropriate etchants. The graphite is not attacked by most etchants, so it will appear as dark flakes.
